in the bash 
cd will do same as in cmd 
touch will creat a new file 
git init % will create a git repo for the folder 
git add index.txt
git rm --cached index.txt
git add . % this will add everything 
git commit 
git fetch 
git pull % merge+ fetch % what pull does is it will apply all the changes on the hub and apply to the local repo 
git push -u origin master 
git clone  https://github.com/Longwu2000/my-git_try-.git
